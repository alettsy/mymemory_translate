# mymemory_translate

A simple API to get and manage translations from the
[MyMemory](https://mymemory.translated.net/) translation REST API.

A full specification for the API can be found 
[here](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php).

## Getting started

In your Flutter project add the dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
    ...
    mymemory_translate:
```

or run `flutter pub add mymemory_translate`.

## Usage Examples

TODO: usage examples

## Current Issues

- The `subjects` endpoint seems to be missing from the API so there is
  no way to get the list of allowed subjects at the moment.
